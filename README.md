# ShortFaceWebAPI
This is a simple web API for facial recognition. It includes two main endpoints: 1. **Register Face**: Registers a new face and saves the corresponding image to local disk. 2. **Recognize Face**: Identifies faces in images using the registered faces.  The registered faces are stored locally on the server's file system.
